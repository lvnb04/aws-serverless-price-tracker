## ✨ Key Features

* 🎯 **Dynamic Tracking Services:** Users can select one of three tracking modes:
    1.  **Price Tracking:** Get an alert when a product's price drops below a set target.
    2.  **Stock Tracking:** Get a one-time alert when an out-of-stock item becomes available.
    3.  **Both:** Get a combined alert for either event.
* 📬 **Multi-Channel Notifications:** Receive instant confirmation and alert messages via **Amazon SES (Email)** or **Telegram**.
* 🤖 **Smart Validation Logic:** The application is stateless but smart. The API scrapes product data *on ingestion* and will return a `400 Bad Request` error if a user tries to track the stock for an item that is already *in stock*, preventing a bad request from ever entering the database.
* ⚙️ **Fully Automated & Serverless:** A "set it and forget it" system. An **AWS EventBridge** schedule runs the scraper daily with no manual intervention. The entire application is 100% serverless, meaning it costs virtually nothing when not in use.
* 🚀 **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** The *entire* application stack—from the S3 frontend to the API, Lambdas, and database—is defined in a single Python file using the **AWS CDK**. This allows for reliable, repeatable, and automated deployments.

## 🏗️ Architecture Deep Dive

The entire application is built on a "two-flow" serverless, event-driven model:

1.  **Flow 1 (The "Ingestion" API):** A real-time, user-facing flow for adding new products.
2.  **Flow 2 (The "Scheduled Worker"):** An automated, backend flow for checking prices and sending alerts.

### 1. Cost & Scalability (AWS Free Tier)

This architecture is designed to be **extremely cost-effective**. For the vast majority of personal projects, this application can be run entirely within the **AWS Free Tier**.

* **AWS Lambda:** 1 million free requests per month.
* **API Gateway (HTTP API):** 1 million free calls per month.
* **DynamoDB:** 25 GB of storage and 25 write/read capacity units (WCU/RCU). By using **On-Demand (Pay Per Request) Billing**, the application costs $0 when idle.
* **Amazon S3:** 5 GB of free storage.
* **Amazon EventBridge:** 14 million free events per month.
* **Amazon SES:** 1,000 free emails per month when called from a Lambda function.

This means you can run a powerful, scalable application that checks thousands of products per day for virtually **$0.00**.

### 2. Modular & Extensible Design (Open-Closed Principle)

This project follows the **Open-Closed Principle** ("open for extension, but closed for modification"). The core logic is decoupled from its specific tools, making it highly maintainable and adaptable.

* **Swappable Scraper:** The `scrapePrice` Lambda's job is *orchestration*, not scraping. It calls an external scraper API. If I want to switch from `ScraperAPI` to `BrightData` (or even a self-hosted `Selenium` grid), I only need to modify the internal `scrape_product` helper function. The main Lambda handler and all its surrounding logic (DynamoDB scans, alert routing) remain **unchanged**.
* **Swappable Notifications:** The alert logic is a simple router. If I want to add `Twilio (SMS)` or `Slack` notifications, I simply add a new `elif notification_type == 'SMS':` block and a `send_sms_alert()` function. The existing, working Email and Telegram code is **never modified**, eliminating the risk of regression.

### 3. Why This Design? (Service-by-Service Breakdown)

* **Why AWS CDK?**
    Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the modern standard for cloud deployment. Instead of manually clicking in the AWS console (which is error-prone and not repeatable), I chose to define the entire stack in Python. This allows for 100% reproducible deployments, version control (via Git), and automated CI/CD pipelines. The CDK "synthesizes" this Python code into a robust AWS CloudFormation template.

* **Why Two Lambda Functions? (Single Responsibility Principle)**
    The application is split into two functions, each with one distinct job:
    1.  **`addProduct` (The "Ingestion" Lambda):** Handles the user-facing API request. Its *only* job is to validate and ingest a new product. I optimized it for a fast 30-second timeout to give the user a quick response.
    2.  **`scrapePrice` (The "Worker" Lambda):** Handles the backend processing. Its *only* job is to check products. This function is triggered by a schedule, not a user, so I optimized it for a long runtime (15-minute timeout) to process a large database without timing out.
    This separation makes the application easier to debug, scale, and maintain.

* **Why API Gateway (HTTP API)?**
    I needed a public "front door" for my `addProduct` Lambda. I chose the **HTTP API** over the older REST API because it's up to 70% cheaper, has lower latency, and is simpler to configure for a basic Lambda proxy, which was all I needed.

* **Why DynamoDB (NoSQL)?**
    My data is a simple key-value store (`ProductURL` ➡️ `data`). I don't need complex relational joins. A NoSQL, serverless database like **DynamoDB** is the perfect fit. Using **On-Demand (Pay Per Request) Billing** is the most critical feature, as it allows the table to scale from zero requests to thousands per second and back down, with no provisioned capacity to manage.

* **Why EventBridge?**
    I needed a reliable, serverless "cron job" to trigger my `scrapePrice` Lambda. **EventBridge** is the "central nervous system" for AWS Event-Driven Architectures (EDAs) and is the native solution for scheduled events.

* **Why a 3rd Party Scraper API? (The Most Important Decision)**
    Scraping sites like Amazon directly from an AWS Lambda is nearly impossible and destined to fail.
    1.  **IP Blocking:** Amazon instantly blocks requests from AWS datacenter IP addresses.
    2.  **CAPTCHAs & JS Rendering:** Amazon uses JavaScript to load prices and serves CAPTCHAs to block bots. `BeautifulSoup` (bs4) can't run JavaScript, and `Selenium` (a full browser) is too large and slow for a Lambda package.
    3.  **Maintenance Nightmare:** Amazon changes its HTML layout and CSS selectors *weekly* to break scrapers.
    I solved this by outsourcing the most fragile part of the app to a service (like ScraperAPI) whose *entire job* is to manage these problems. My Lambda's job is simply **orchestration**, not scraping.

* **Why Secrets Manager & SES?**
    **Secrets Manager** allows me to securely store and inject my API keys and bot tokens at runtime, keeping them out of my source code. **SES** is a powerful, managed service that allows me to send thousands of emails for pennies, with high deliverability (i.e., not going to spam).

## 🚀 Setup & Deployment

This project is built to be deployed with the AWS CDK.

#### 1. Prerequisites
* Node.js (v16+)
* Python (v3.12+)
* AWS CLI installed and configured (run `aws configure`)

#### 2. Manual AWS Setup (One-time only)

This is the only manual part. The CDK needs three resources to be created first.

* **Amazon SES:**
    1.  Go to the SES console and click "Verified identities."
    2.  Verify an email address (e.g., `you@example.com`). This will be your `SENDER_EMAIL`.
    3.  Make sure you are *out of the SES sandbox* if you want to email other people.

* **AWS Secrets Manager:**
    1.  Go to the Secrets Manager console and create a new secret.
    2.  Store two "Key-Value" pairs:
        * `SCRAPER_API_KEY`: `(your_scraper_api_key)`
        * `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`: `(your_telegram_bot_token)`
    3.  Note the **name** of your secret (e.g., `PriceTrackerSecrets`).

* **AWS Lambda Layer (Local Setup):**
    Your Lambda functions need the `requests` and `beautifulsoup4` libraries. You will need to create a Layer for them.
    1.  On your local machine, create a folder and install the packages:
        ```bash
        mkdir -p my-scraper-layer/python
        pip install requests beautifulsoup4 -t ./my-scraper-layer/python
        ```
    2.  Zip the *contents* of the `my-scraper-layer` folder (the `python` directory):
        ```bash
        cd my-scraper-layer
        zip -r ../scraper_layer.zip .
        cd ..
        ```
    3.  Go to the Lambda console > "Layers" > "Create Layer".
    4.  Name it (e.g., `ScraperLayer`), upload your `scraper_layer.zip` file, and select the `Python 3.12` runtime.
    5.  Once created, click on your new layer and **copy its Version ARN**.

#### 3. Configure the CDK Code
* Clone this repository.
* Open `cdk_price_tracker/cdk_price_tracker_stack.py`.
* Update the placeholder values in the `__init__` method with the resources you just created:
    * `YOUR_MANUAL_SECRET_NAME` ➡️ Your secret name (e.g., `PriceTrackerSecrets`)
    * `YOUR_MANUAL_LAYER_ARN` ➡️ The full Layer Version ARN you copied.
    * `YOUR_VERIFIED_SENDER_EMAIL` ➡️ The email you verified with SES.

#### 4. Deploy the Stack
* Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
* Bootstrap your AWS account for CDK (one-time command per region):
    ```bash
    cdk bootstrap
    ```
* Deploy the application:
    ```bash
    cdk deploy
    ```
* The terminal will ask you to confirm security changes. Review them and press `y`.
* When finished, the terminal will output two URLs: `CdkApiEndpoint` and `CdkWebsiteURL`.

#### 5. Final Frontend Configuration
* The CDK deployed your website with a placeholder API URL. It needs to be updated with the *real* URL.
* Copy the `CdkApiEndpoint` output from your terminal.
* Open `assets/frontend/script.js` and paste this URL into the `API_ENDPOINT` variable.
* Run `cdk deploy` **one more time**. The CDK is smart and will detect only the S3 bucket needs updating, so this will be very fast.

Your website is now live at the `CdkWebsiteURL`!

## 🔮 Future Work

This project has a strong foundation for more features:

* **User Authentication:** Use **AWS Cognito** to add user sign-up and login. This would involve updating the API Gateway to use a Cognito Authorizer and adding a `UserID` as a primary or sort key in DynamoDB to secure user data.
* **Price History Dashboard:** Modify the `scrapePrice` Lambda to *append* the new price to a list in DynamoDB instead of just overwriting it. A new `GET /products/{id}` API route could fetch this history, which a frontend (using Chart.js) could then display as a graph.
* **ML Price Prediction:** Once price history is being collected, this time-series data could be fed into **Amazon SageMaker**. A simple model (like ARIMA or Prophet) could be trained and exposed via a new Lambda function to predict if a price is likely to drop further.
* **CI/CD Pipeline:** Create a **GitHub Actions** workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) that automatically lints, tests, and runs `cdk deploy --require-approval never` on every push to the `main` branch, creating a fully automated deployment pipeline.
