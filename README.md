CloudTrack is a full-stack, serverless application that automatically monitors e-commerce product prices and stock availability. Users submit a product URL via a web interface and can choose to be notified of a price drop, a restock, or both. A daily automated process scrapes the product, and if an alert is triggered, the system sends an instant notification via Email or Telegram. The entire infrastructure—from the S3-hosted frontend to the API, Lambda functions, and database—is defined and deployed as a single, automated stack using the AWS CDK.

## ✨ Key Features

* 🎯 **Dynamic Tracking Services:** Users can select one of three tracking modes:
    1.  **Price Tracking:** Get an alert when a product's price drops below a set target.
    2.  **Stock Tracking:** Get a one-time alert when an out-of-stock item becomes available.
    3.  **Both:** Get a combined alert for either event.
* 📬 **Multi-Channel Notifications:** Receive instant confirmation and alert messages via **Amazon SES (Email)** or **Telegram**.
* 🤖 **Smart Validation Logic:** The application is stateless but smart. The API scrapes product data *on ingestion* and will return a `400 Bad Request` error if a user tries to track the stock for an item that is already *in stock*, preventing a bad request from ever entering the database.
* ⚙️ **Fully Automated & Serverless:** A "set it and forget it" system. An **AWS EventBridge** schedule runs the scraper daily with no manual intervention. The entire application is 100% serverless, meaning it costs virtually nothing when not in use.
* 🚀 **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** The *entire* application stack—from the S3 frontend to the API, Lambdas, and database—is defined in a single Python file using the **AWS CDK**. This allows for reliable, repeatable, and automated deployments.

## 🏗️ Architecture Deep Dive

The entire application is built on a "two-flow" serverless, event-driven model:

1.  **Flow 1 (The "Ingestion" API):** A real-time, user-facing flow for adding new products.
2.  **Flow 2 (The "Scheduled Worker"):** An automated, backend flow for checking prices and sending alerts.

### 1. 💰 Cost & Scalability (AWS Free Tier)

This architecture is designed to be **extremely cost-effective**. For the vast majority of personal projects, this application can be run entirely within the **AWS Free Tier**.

* **AWS Lambda:** 1 million free requests per month.
* **API Gateway (HTTP API):** 1 million free calls per month.
* **DynamoDB:** 25 GB of storage. By using **On-Demand (Pay Per Request) Billing**, the application costs $0 when idle.
* **Amazon S3:** 5 GB of free storage.
* **Amazon EventBridge:** 14 million free events per month.
* **Amazon SES:** 1,000 free emails per month when called from a Lambda function.

This means you can run a powerful, scalable application that checks thousands of products per day for virtually **$0.00**.

### 2. 💡 Core Software Design Principles 

This project was built adhering to key SOLID principles, making the architecture robust, maintainable, and extensible.

* **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**
    Each component in the architecture has one, and only one, reason to change.
    * **`addProduct` Lambda:** Its *single responsibility* is to ingest, validate, and save a new product. Its one "reason to change" is if the business logic for *adding* a product changes.
    * **`scrapePrice` Lambda:** Its *single responsibility* is to check existing products. Its one "reason to change" is if the *alerting* logic changes.
    * **`cdk_price_tracker_stack.py`:** Its *single responsibility* is to define infrastructure. It knows nothing about scraping or business logic.
    This separation ensures that a failure in one part (like the `scrapePrice` worker) has zero impact on another (like the `addProduct` API).

* **Open-Closed Principle (OCP):**
    The application is "open for extension, but closed for modification." The core logic is decoupled from its specific tools.
    * **Swappable Scraper:** The `scrapePrice` Lambda's job is *orchestration*. If I want to switch from `ScraperAPI` to `BrightData`, I only need to modify the internal `scrape_product` helper function. The main Lambda handler and its surrounding logic remain **unchanged**.
    * **Swappable Notifications:** The alert logic is a simple router. If I want to add `Twilio (SMS)` or `Slack` notifications, I simply add a new `elif notification_type == 'SMS':` block and a `send_sms_alert()` function. The existing, working Email and Telegram code is **never modified**, eliminating the risk of regression.

* **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):**
    High-level modules do not depend on low-level modules; both depend on abstractions.
    * **High-Level Module:** The main `lambda_handler` in `scrapePrice.py`, which contains the core business logic (scan, loop, check, alert).
    * **Low-Level Module:** The `boto3` client for SES or the `requests` call to the Telegram API.
    * **Abstraction:** The helper functions (`send_email_alert()`, `send_telegram_alert()`).
    The `lambda_handler` only depends on the `send_email_alert()` abstraction, not on the `boto3` implementation. This allows me to completely change *how* emails are sent (e.g., switch to SendGrid) just by modifying the helper function, without touching the main business logic.

### 3. ⚙️ Why This Design? (Service-by-Service Breakdown)

* **Why AWS CDK?**
    Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the modern standard for cloud deployment. Instead of manually clicking in the AWS console (which is error-prone and not repeatable), I chose to define the entire stack in Python. This allows for 100% reproducible deployments, version control (via Git), and automated CI/CD pipelines. The CDK "synthesizes" this Python code into a robust AWS CloudFormation template.

* **Why Two Lambda Functions? (SRP)**
    As described in the SOLID principles, the application is split into two functions (`addProduct` and `scrapePrice`) to ensure a clean separation of concerns. This makes the system more resilient, as a failure in the backend worker (Flow 2) does not affect the user-facing API (Flow 1).

* **Why API Gateway (HTTP API)?**
    I needed a public "front door" for my `addProduct` Lambda. I chose the **HTTP API** over the older REST API because it's up to 70% cheaper, has lower latency, and is simpler to configure for a basic Lambda proxy, which was all I needed.

* **Why DynamoDB (NoSQL)?**
    My data is a simple key-value store (`ProductURL` ➡️ `data`). I don't need complex relational joins. A NoSQL, serverless database like **DynamoDB** is the perfect fit. Using **On-Demand (Pay Per Request) Billing** is the most critical feature, as it allows the table to scale from zero requests to thousands per second and back down, with no provisioned capacity to manage.

* **Why EventBridge?**
    I needed a reliable, serverless "cron job" to trigger my `scrapePrice` Lambda. **EventBridge** is the "central nervous system" for AWS Event-Driven Architectures (EDAs) and is the native solution for scheduled events.

* **Why a 3rd Party Scraper API?**
    Scraping sites like Amazon directly from an AWS Lambda is nearly impossible and destined to fail.
    1.  **IP Blocking:** Amazon instantly blocks requests from AWS datacenter IP addresses.
    2.  **CAPTCHAs & JS Rendering:** Amazon uses JavaScript to load prices and serves CAPTCHAs to block bots. `BeautifulSoup` (bs4) can't run JavaScript, and `Selenium` (a full browser) is too large and slow for a Lambda package.
    3.  **Maintenance Nightmare:** Amazon changes its HTML layout and CSS selectors *weekly* to break scrapers.
    I solved this by outsourcing the most fragile part of the app to a service (like ScraperAPI) whose *entire job* is to manage these problems. My Lambda's job now is **orchestration**, not scraping.

* **Why Secrets Manager & SES?**
    **Secrets Manager** allows me to securely store and inject my API keys and bot tokens at runtime, keeping them out of my source code. **SES** is a powerful, managed service that allows me to send thousands of emails for pennies, with high deliverability (i.e., not going to spam).

### 4. 🔒 Security & Permissions (IAM)

A key part of this project is adhering to the **Principle of Least Privilege**. The AWS CDK automatically creates IAM Roles for each Lambda function, but they don't get permissions for *everything*.

The CDK's `grant_read_data()` (for Secrets Manager) and `grant_read_write_data()` (for DynamoDB) are high-level "constructs" that automatically create the correct policies.

However, to send email, I had to **manually add a custom policy** to each Lambda's execution role. This ensures the Lambdas can *only* access SES and no other services unnecessarily.

Here is the JSON for the custom IAM policy statement that the CDK attaches to both Lambda roles:
```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": "ses:SendEmail",
  "Resource": "*"
}
```
*(Note: In a production environment with multiple apps, this `Resource` would be restricted to a specific SES identity ARN.)*

## 🚀 Setup & Deployment

This project is built to be deployed with the AWS CDK.

#### 1. Prerequisites
* Node.js (v16+)
* Python (v3.12+)
* AWS CLI installed and configured (run `aws configure`)

#### 2. Manual AWS Setup (One-time only)

This is the only manual part. The CDK needs three resources to be created first.

* **Amazon SES:**
    1.  Go to the SES console and click "Verified identities."
    2.  Verify an email address (e.g., `you@example.com`). This will be your `SENDER_EMAIL`.
    3.  **IMPORTANT:** By default, your SES account is in a **Sandbox**. This means you can *only* send emails *to* other verified addresses.
    4.  **To go to Production:** You must request production access from the SES console. This involves explaining your use case (e.g., "This is a personal project to send price alerts to myself and friends who opt-in"). Once approved, you can email any address.

* **AWS Secrets Manager:**
    1.  Go to the Secrets Manager console and create a new secret.
    2.  Store two "Key-Value" pairs:
        * `SCRAPER_API_KEY`: `(your_scraper_api_key)`
        * `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`: `(your_telegram_bot_token)`
    3.  Note the **name** of your secret (e.g., `PriceTrackerSecrets`).

* **AWS Lambda Layer (Local Setup):**
    Your Lambda functions need the `requests` and `beautifulsoup4` libraries. You will need to create a Layer for them.
    1.  On your local machine, create a folder and install the packages:
        ```bash
        mkdir -p my-scraper-layer/python
        pip install requests beautifulsoup4 -t ./my-scraper-layer/python
        ```
    2.  Zip the *contents* of the `my-scraper-layer` folder (the `python` directory):
        ```bash
        cd my-scraper-layer
        zip -r ../scraper_layer.zip .
        cd ..
        ```
    3.  Go to the Lambda console > "Layers" > "Create Layer".
    4.  Name it (e.g., `ScraperLayer`), upload your `scraper_layer.zip` file, and select the `Python 3.12` runtime.
    5.  Once created, click on your new layer and **copy its Version ARN**.

#### 3. Configure the CDK Code
* Clone this repository.
* Open `cdk_price_tracker/cdk_price_tracker_stack.py`.
* Update the placeholder values in the `__init__` method with the resources you just created:
    * `YOUR_MANUAL_SECRET_NAME` ➡️ Your secret name (e.g., `PriceTrackerSecrets`)
    * `YOUR_MANUAL_LAYER_ARN` ➡️ The full Layer Version ARN you copied.
    * `YOUR_VERIFIED_SENDER_EMAIL` ➡️ The email you verified with SES.

#### 4. Deploy the Stack
* Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
* Bootstrap your AWS account for CDK (one-time command per region):
    ```bash
    cdk bootstrap
    ```
* Deploy the application:
    ```bash
    cdk deploy
    ```
* The terminal will ask you to confirm security changes. Review them and press `y`.
* When finished, the terminal will output two URLs: `CdkApiEndpoint` and `CdkWebsiteURL`.

#### 5. Final Frontend Configuration
* The CDK deployed your website with a placeholder API URL. It needs to be updated with the *real* URL.
* Copy the `CdkApiEndpoint` output from your terminal.
* Open `assets/frontend/script.js` and paste this URL into the `API_ENDPOINT` variable.
* Run `cdk deploy` **one more time**. The CDK is smart and will detect only the S3 bucket needs updating, so this will be very fast.

Your website is now live at the `CdkWebsiteURL`!

## 🔮 Future Work

This project has a strong foundation for more features:

* **User Authentication:** Use **AWS Cognito** to add user sign-up and login. This would involve updating the API Gateway to use a Cognito Authorizer and adding a `UserID` as a primary or sort key in DynamoDB to secure user data.
* **Price History Dashboard:** Modify the `scrapePrice` Lambda to *append* the new price to a list in DynamoDB instead of just overwriting it. A new `GET /products/{id}` API route could fetch this history, which a frontend (using Chart.js) could then display as a graph.
* **ML Price Prediction:** Once price history is being collected, this time-series data could be fed into **Amazon SageMaker**. A simple model (like ARIMA or Prophet) could be trained and exposed via a new Lambda function to predict if a price is likely to drop further.
* **CI/CD Pipeline:** Create a **GitHub Actions** workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) that automatically lints, tests, and runs `cdk deploy --require-approval never` on every push to the `main` branch, creating a fully automated deployment pipeline.
